BankAccount Assignment
======================

### Learning Objectives:

*   Practice member variables
*   Practice instance methods and getters
*   Implement static variables and methods

* * *

We are going to create a BankAccount class. This class will recreate some of the common account transactions that normally occur for a bank account, such as displaying your account number, checking and savings amount, total amount. Of course, there are also methods to invoke, such as depositing a check, checking your balance, and withdrawing money.

To get started, we will create the following two files:

### BankAccount.java

```
public class BankAccount {
    // MEMBER VARIABLES
    private double checkingBalance;
    private double savingsBalance;

    private static int accounts;
    private static double totalMoney; // refers to the sum of all bank account checking and savings balances

    // CONSTRUCTOR
    // Be sure to increment the number of accounts

    // GETTERS
    // for checking, savings, accounts, and totalMoney

    // METHODS
    // deposit
    // - users should be able to deposit money into their checking or savings account
    // withdraw 
    // - users should be able to withdraw money from their checking or savings account
    // - do not allow them to withdraw money if there are insufficient funds
    // - all deposits and withdrawals should affect totalMoney
    // getBalance
    // - display total balance for checking and savings of a particular bank account
}
```

### BankTest.java
```
public class BankTest {
    public static void main(String\[\] args){
        // Create 3 bank accounts

        // Deposit Test
        // - deposit some money into each bank account's checking or savings account and display the balance each time
        // - each deposit should increase the amount of totalMoney

        // Withdrawal Test
        // - withdraw some money from each bank account's checking or savings account and display the remaining balance
        // - each withdrawal should decrease the amount of totalMoney

        // Static Test (print the number of bank accounts and the totalMoney)

    }
}
```

Review the starting code and be sure to test your classes thoroughly.

*   Create a BankAccount class with the correct member variables and methods.
    
*   Users should not be able to set any of the attributes from the class.
    
*   Create a BankTest class to test each BankAccount method you have created.
    
*   Ninja Bonus 1: Add the following class attribute: account number. The type is up to you, can be a String or a Long or another type.
    
*   Ninja Bonus 2: Create a private method that returns a random ten digit account number.
    
*   Ninja Bonus 3: In the constructor, call the private method from above so that each user has a random ten-digit account.
